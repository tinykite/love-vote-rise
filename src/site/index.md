You can [request an absentee ballot online](https://mnvotes.sos.state.mn.us/ABRegistration/ABRegistrationStep1.aspx) or visit an early voting polling station.

### By Mail

If you've requested to vote by mail, it is recommended to send in your ballot 2 weeks before election day (by Oct 20). Alternatively, you can fill out a early voting ballot and return it in-person to an early voting station.

### In Person

Early polling stations are set up to allow individuals to drop-off absentee ballots or fill out a ballot on-site.
