## Register to Vote

[Check your voter registration status](https://mnvotes.sos.state.mn.us/VoterStatus.aspx)

Not registered yet? [Register to vote online](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/register-to-vote/)

## Vote Early

You can [request an absentee ballot online](https://mnvotes.sos.state.mn.us/ABRegistration/ABRegistrationStep1.aspx) or visit an early voting station to fill out a ballot in-person.

### By Mail

If you've receive an absentee ballot in the mail at least 2 weeks before the election, you can choose to fill it out and drop it in the mail. Don't worry if it's later than that date — you can drop also off your absentee ballot at a early voting station in-person.

### In Person

Early polling stations are set up to allow individuals to drop-off absentee ballots or fill out a ballot on-site.

[Find your early voting polling station](https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/find-county-election-office/)

The last day for early voting is November 2nd. Don’t forget to take your mask.

### Track Your Ballot

In Minnesota, voters can check on the status of their ballots with [this online form](https://mnvotes.sos.state.mn.us/AbsenteeBallotStatus.aspx).
